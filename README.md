In this challenge, I first started with mouse data and the study results in two different files. In order to accurately compare Capomulin with the other drug regimen's, I merged these dataframes together and deleted duplicate data to create a clean dataframe. After this, I used the groupby function to calculate the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen (Image 1 below).
